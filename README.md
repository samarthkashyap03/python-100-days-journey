# Python 100 Days – Learning Journey

This repository documents my **Python learning journey**, organized in a day-by-day format inspired by the *100 Days of Python* course.

It contains small projects, exercises, and mini-applications built to strengthen Python fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and real-world usage such as APIs, file handling, GUIs, and automation.

The purpose of this repository is **learning through consistent building**, not showcasing fully polished production applications.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized chronologically by days.

- Each folder named `day-XX` represents work done on that day
- Inside each day folder, projects are kept in their own subfolders
- Some days contain multiple projects, while others contain only one
- GitHub may visually collapse folders such as `day-01/project-name`; this is a UI behavior and does not affect the actual structure

## 🧠 What This Repository Covers

Across different days, projects explore topics including:

- Python basics and control flow  
- Functions and modular programming  
- File handling and JSON  
- Error handling  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- GUI applications using Tkinter  
- API usage and automation  
- Environment variables and secrets management  
- Small utilities and practice scripts  

Not all projects are intended to be standalone applications. Many are learning-focused exercises by design.

## 🔐 Environment Variables and Security

Some projects require API keys or credentials.

- Real secrets are **never committed** to the repository
- Projects that require configuration include a `.env.example` file

To run such projects locally:
1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`
2. Add your own keys or credentials

Projects will fail clearly if required environment variables are missing. This follows standard security and configuration practices.

## 🚀 Running a Project

Each project is independent.

General steps to run a project:

1. Navigate to the project directory inside the appropriate day folder
2. Install dependencies if a `requirements.txt` file is present
3. Run the main Python file

Some smaller scripts do not require any external dependencies.

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **learning repository**, not a production portfolio
- Code quality and structure improve progressively over time
- Selected projects may later be refactored into standalone portfolio repositories

## 👤 About Me

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany, with strong proficiency in Python and a problem-solving mindset. I enjoy building practical projects to deepen my understanding of software engineering concepts, APIs, automation, and application development, while continuously improving code quality and structure.
