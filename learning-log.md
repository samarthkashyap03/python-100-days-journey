# Learning Log

This file records what I worked on and learned while building Python projects from Day 1.  


---

## Day 01–03: Basics and Simple Logic
- Learned Python basics like variables, input/output, and conditionals
- Wrote small programs such as tip calculator, BMI calculator, and decision-based scripts
- Got comfortable running Python programs and understanding basic errors

---

## Day 04–05: Lists, Loops, and Random module
- Learned how lists work and how to loop over them
- Used for-loops and while-loops in small programs
- Built simple games like Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Created a password generator using random values

---

## Day 06–07: Loops and Game Flow
- Practiced while-loops and repeated user input
- Built the Hangman game using procedural programming
- Later explored an OOP version of the same game
- Started understanding how larger programs need better structure

---

## Day 08–10: Functions and Code Organization
- Learned how to write and use functions properly
- Built projects like Caesar Cipher, calculator, and silent auction
- Focused on breaking code into smaller reusable parts
- Improved readability by organizing logic into functions

---

## Day 11–12: First OOP Projects
- Built games like Blackjack and Number Guessing
- Compared procedural code with object-oriented code
- Learned how classes store state and behavior
- Understood why OOP helps in managing bigger programs

---

## Day 13–15: Debugging and Larger Programs
- Spent time debugging logic errors and fixing broken flows
- Learned basic error handling
- Built the Coffee Machine project in both procedural and OOP styles

---

## Day 16–20: OOP and Game Development
- Worked on Turtle graphics projects
- Built the Snake game using multiple classes
- Learned how different classes interact with each other
- Implemented features like scoring and saving high scores to files

---

## Day 21–25: Working with Files and Data
- Learned to read and write files
- Worked with CSV files and JSON data
- Built projects like Mail Merge and U.S. States guessing game
- Used pandas for basic data handling and filtering

---

## Day 26–27: Dictionaries and GUIs
- Built the NATO Alphabet project using dictionaries and CSV data
- Started learning Tkinter for GUI applications
- Built simple GUI tools like unit converters
- Learned how button clicks and events work

---

## Day 28–30: GUI Apps with State
- Built a Pomodoro Timer using Tkinter
- Built a Password Manager using JSON for storage
- Learned input validation and basic UI logic
- Understood how GUI programs manage state differently than console apps

---

## Day 31–35: APIs and Automation
- Learned how to use APIs with the requests library
- Built projects like stock alerts and weather alerts
- Learned how to use environment variables instead of hardcoding keys
- Handled API responses and basic error cases

---

## Day 36–39: Automation and Integration
- Worked on automation scripts using email and messaging APIs
- Integrated multiple services in single scripts
- Improved understanding of configuration using environment variables
- Focused on making scripts reusable and configurable

---

## Day 40-45: Web Development and Scraping
- Learnt about HTML,CSS
- Learnt about Beautiful Soup and web scraping
- Did projects with bs4

---

## Key Takeaways So Far
- Improved confidence in Python by building many small projects
- Learned how to structure code as projects grow
- Became more comfortable debugging and fixing errors
- Gained experience with OOP, GUIs, APIs, and automation
- Developed better habits around project organization and security

---

## Next Goals
- Refactor selected projects for cleaner code
- Add documentation to important projects
- Improve error handling and validation
- Build slightly larger, more realistic applications
- Progress till Day 100 consistently
